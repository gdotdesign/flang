## Identifier
An identifier is similar to the [XML Specification - Name](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name), but much more strict: `[a-z][a-z0-9-_]+`

  * **[a-z]** - It must start with a lowercase letter
  * **[a-z0-9-_]+** - Then it can only contain lowercase letters and dash `-` and underscoe `_` characters
